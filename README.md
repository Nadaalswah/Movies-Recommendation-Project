## User Recommender
### Models Used:
* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)
* LightFM (Final Model)
### Training Process:
The models were trained using the MovieLens dataset to predict user preferences.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the performance of each model.
The final model, LightFM, was selected based on its performance and accuracy.

## Item Similarity
Calculation Method:
Item similarities are calculated on demand when an item is selected.
Cosine similarity is used to find the top-N similar items.
